# Well Balance v2: Embracing AI to Work Smarter

# The Well Balance v1

Last year, I created *Well Balance* — a set of reminder tools designed specifically for people who work from home (WFH). You can check it out here: [wellbalance.vercel.app](https://wellbalance.vercel.app). The goal was simple but meaningful: help WFH workers *stay balanced* and *active throughout the day*. 

## From Solo Effort to AI Collaboration

Back then, building the app was *completely my own work*. It took days of coding, testing, and refining to get a functional product up and running.

Fast forward to 2025 — the year of AI — and everything has changed. I recently discovered a new AI tool from Vercel, called v0, which I had heard great things about. Curious, I set out to recreate an updated version of my app, *Well-Balance v1*, using this AI-powered assistant. The results blew me away.

With just a few prompts and some context, the AI helped generate a much **more robust and complete app** than I had originally built. The process was astonishingly fast - what took me days last year was achieved in just about **one hour**.

## The Reality of AI-Assisted Development

Of course, perfection isn’t immediate. Some parts, like the weather tool and scheduling feature, still need fine-tuning to show real, accurate data. But the **speed and efficiency gains** are undeniable and inspiring.

This experience brings a crucial question: **If AI can help us build quality tools so quickly, why not create more of them?** The traditional barriers—limited time, effort, and knowledge—are being transformed by powerful AI assistants. 

## Looking Ahead

As we embrace AI in development, we have the opportunity to accelerate progress, build tools that enhance our daily lives, and foster better work-life balance for everyone, especially those working remotely. I’m excited to keep improving Well-Balance and exploring what AI can help us create next.
