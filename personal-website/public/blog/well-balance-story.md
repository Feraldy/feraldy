# Well Balance: Building a Wellness Tracker

# The Problem That Start It All

Working from home has become the new normal for many of us, and while it offers flexibility, it also comes with a significant challenge — **staying physically active**. For me, during the height of working from home, I found myself sitting down for more than 14 hours a day: 9 hours of work, and another 5 hours of play or entertainment. This sedentary lifestyle was beginning to take a toll on my health and energy levels.

## The Spark: A Simple Reminder to Move

I wanted a simple, effective way to remind myself to **take breaks and walk regularly** throughout the day. This led me to create a small web tool that would alert me to walk for a few minutes after every set number of hours spent sitting. The idea was straightforward — build something for myself to encourage healthy habits while working and relaxing at home.

## Personal Experience and Learning Journey

While researching, I discovered many popular techniques and methods for maintaining health and balance during long work sessions—like the **20-20-20 method** for eye health and the **Pomodoro technique** for productivity and breaks. These inspired parts of the design and functionality of my tool.

At the same time, I was rediscovering my passion for front-end development. I wanted to deepen my skills, so I chose to build what became WellBalance using **React** and **Next.js**, with **Material-UI (MUI)** to help with the interface components. The project became both a practical tool and a learning experience.

The product is **gimmicky and experimental** in UI/UX design, and definitely a work in progress. However, it’s **fully functional** and meets my core needs: a walk reminder, a note-taking feature, and a simple to-do tracker. WellBalance represents a meaningful step forward in my coding journey and personal productivity.

## Building WellBalance: From Idea to Reality

The project evolved from a simple reminder tool into a suite of small but practical web utilities hosted at [WellBalance](https://wellbalance.vercel.app). Here’s how I approached the creation:

- **Identifying the Need:** Targeting the problem of prolonged sedentary behavior and lack of regular breaks.
- **Designing the Core Features:** Customizable timers for walking reminders, notes, and task tracking.
- **Technologies:** Built with React and Next.js for a modern, responsive front-end experience, using Material-UI for UI components.
- **Experimental UI/UX:** While the interface is not fully polished, it focuses on usability and learning new front-end concepts.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel for smooth, easy access anywhere.

## Outcome and Future Thoughts

Creating WellBalance helped me address my sedentary lifestyle and motivated me to explore how technology can promote healthier habits. While the tools are simple, they form a foundation for future enhancements and more comprehensive productivity and wellness solutions.

If you’re facing similar challenges balancing work, health, and leisure—especially while working from home—I encourage you to check out [WellBalance](https://wellbalance.vercel.app) and consider building or using simple tools like this to support your well-being.


## Try It Yourself

WellBalance is live at [wellbalance.vercel.app](https://wellbalance.vercel.app). It's completely free to use and requires no sign-up - your data stays private on your device.

**Please note:** All your notes and to-do items are saved locally in your browser's localStorage. This means that your data **never leaves your device**, but it also means that if you clear your browser data, switch browsers, or devices, your saved information will be lost. Therefore, **avoid storing any credentials, confidential, or sensitive information** in the notes or to-do sections.

The project represents my belief that technology should enhance our well-being, not detract from it. Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones.
