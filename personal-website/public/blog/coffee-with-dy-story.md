# Why and How I Created My Coffee Manual Brew Recipe Calculator

As a home coffee brewer, one of the challenges I often faced was adjusting my brewing recipes based on the amount of coffee beans I wanted to use. Many popular recipes are given in fixed proportions, such as the 4:6 Tetsu method which uses 20 grams of coffee to 300 ml of water. But what if I want to brew just 15 grams of coffee? Then I have to recalculate the total water volume and the amount poured at each step manually.

To solve this problem, I created my first functional live web app: a **coffee manual brew recipe calculator**. You can check it out here: [CoffeeWith-DY](https://coffeewith-dy.vercel.app).

## The Problem

Adjusting recipes by hand can be tedious and error-prone, especially when the pouring schedule is divided into multiple pours, like the popular 4:6 or James Hoffman's methods. Each pour has to be recalculated based on the new coffee dose and brewing ratio.

## How It Works

My app allows you to select from several predefined recipes, including:

- The classic **4:6 Tetsu** ratio
- James Hoffman's V60 method
- Matt Winton's V60 five-pour

You can also create a **custom recipe** where you specify the coffee dose and desired ratio. The calculator then automatically calculates total water volume and the water amount for each pour, making it easy to adjust any recipe on the fly.

## Why I Built It

As a practical tool for home brewers like me, this app bridges the gap between fixed recipes and personalized brewing. Instead of relying on mental math or rough estimates, brewers can precisely scale recipes up or down, preserving the intended flavors and balance.

## Future Improvements

While the current version is functional, there are exciting improvements I want to add in the future:

- Adding more predefined recipes to cover a wider range of brewing styles
- Allowing deeper customization of pour schedules (e.g., user-defined ml per pour)
- Features to save, share, and manage your custom recipes for easy access

For now, it’s a handy, practical tool that gets the job done. I’m excited to continue improving it as I learn more and get feedback from fellow coffee enthusiasts.

## Try the Perfect Brew

Experience Coffee with Dy at [coffeewith-dy.vercel.app](https://coffeewith-dy.vercel.app). Whether you're new to pour-over or a seasoned coffee enthusiast, the app will guide you to consistently excellent coffee.

The project represents my belief that technology should enhance our daily rituals, not complicate them. Sometimes the best apps are the ones that disappear into the background, letting you focus on what matters - in this case, that perfect cup of coffee.
