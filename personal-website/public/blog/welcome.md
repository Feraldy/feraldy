# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I'll share my thoughts on development, tools, and technology.

## Getting Started

This blog supports **Markdown** formatting, so I can easily write posts with:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- Links and more!

### Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

Stay tuned for more posts about my projects and development journey!
